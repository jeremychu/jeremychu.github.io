__Who are you?__

I'm a development manager based in London, England.

__What do you do?__

Currently I'm heading up the development team at a startup called [Adio](http://www.adio.fm).

__What are you interested in?__

iOS, Mobile Web, AngularJS, Node.js and Rails mostly in that order.  I reserve the right to change my mind about any or all of it.

__Why does this blog exist?__

I'm discovering a lot of new things lately and as I'm stumbling my way through it I figured I should post it here in case it helps anyone else.  Let me know if it does.

__Anything else?__

I'm quite partial to a bit of photography on the side.  Check out my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeremychu) if you like.
