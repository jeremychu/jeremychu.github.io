So I decided that I should probably look into Vagrant as it would let me easily provision different development environments lickity split.

Afterwards I decided to look into Docker as it was now > v1.0.0 which means it's ready for production, right?
More on that another time.

During my venture in to the world of Docker I discovered Dokku - "my very own Heroku". Now this was getting interesting...

Digital Ocean has a Dokku ready image that can be deployed and tried out for pennies.  But what if I wanted to work on my local development machine and have it be the same as on Digital Ocean?
